            <p class="text-lg">Our feet, often overlooked, are exposed daily to moisture, warmth, and the tight confines of shoes—perfect conditions for bacteria and fungi to thrive. In places like India, over 10 million people are affected by fungal infections annually. <strong>E.solei</strong>offers a proactive solution to foot health by preventing infections before they start, rather than treating them after they occur. The bio-active insole, made from a polymer bed hosting bio-engineered bacteria, releases <strong>linalool</strong>, a fragrant compound that inhibits harmful microbes. Unlike traditional foot creams or antifungal drugs, E.solei works continuously and can be adapted for other areas prone to infection, such as the groin or prosthetic sites.</p>
            <br>
            <p class="text-lg">The idea for E.solei was born from personal experience and community feedback. One of our team members, struggled with a persistent foot infection, and was forced to miss crucial lab meetings and brainstorming sessions due to another bout of foot fungal infection. This made us realize that foot health was not a minor inconvenience but a significant health issue that demanded attention. Through conversations with dermatologists, foot specialists, athletes, and others, we realized that current treatments were often inadequate. These insights led us to develop E.solei, an accessible and effective product designed to tackle foot health challenges before they become serious problems.</p>

                    "We commonly encounter two types of fungal foot infections: Candida sp. and dermatophyte infections. Candidiasis is prevalent among people working in moist, muddy conditions, while dermatophyte infections are more common in industrial workers who wear closed shoes for long periods. Environmental factors, like keeping pets at home, can increase exposure to foot fungus, and commensal bacteria often cause foot odor."

                  <p class="text-lg">
                    The main causes of fungal infections in diabetic patients include walking barefoot, neglecting foot health, and untreated open wounds. Diabetic patients with neuropathy are particularly vulnerable due to compromised nerve function, which is why custom-made shoes with softer insoles are essential for providing stress relief and preventing infections. In severe cases, foot infections can lead to necrosis and even amputation, so it's crucial to maintain proper blood sugar control, have regular check-ups, and ensure good foot care—such as not walking barefoot and using customized insoles. To reach the diabetic customer segment, I recommend partnering with hospitals to distribute customized insoles and assess their effectiveness. You can conduct randomized control trials, where diabetic patients receive either customized or normal insoles, and monitor their susceptibility to infections over 6 months to 1 year to evaluate the product's benefits.

                  To gather valuable insights for our E. Solei Project, we conducted a survey targeting diverse groups, including students, athletes, office workers, and army personnel. The survey explored common foot issues like fungal infections and odor, along with footwear habits and preferences for foot care products. We also gauged public interest in using genetically modified organisms (GMOs) in foot care, assessing comfort levels and concerns. This feedback is crucial in refining our product to meet real needs while promoting foot health and sustainability.
                  Key areas explored include Demographic Insights, Understanding Foot Issues, Consumer Preferences, and Perceptions of Genetically Modified Bacteria in Footcare. With 200 responses collected through academic institutions and social media, this feedback provides essential guidance for developing innovative, eco-friendly, and effective footcare solutions that align with consumer expectations.

                      <strong>2 Understanding Foot Issues and the Demand for Solutions: </strong> From the survey on foot-related issues, we learned that the majority of respondents (60.5%) commonly use open sandals or flip-flops, followed by casual shoes (52.3%). Interestingly, 35.9% reported frequently experiencing foot odor after long hours of wearing shoes, with 38.8% wearing closed shoes for 5-8 hours daily. Notably, 41.8% of participants have faced foot-related issues like redness and itchiness, with 50% of these individuals mentioning itchiness as the most common problem, alongside dry skin (42.5%) and blisters (35%). Additionally, over half of the respondents (53.1%) who had fungal infections reported recurrence after treatment. This feedback confirms the relevance of our project in addressing common issues such as odor, itchiness, and recurring infections.</p>

                        <strong>3. Consumer Preferences and Product Expectations: </strong> From the survey results, we learned that the most desired benefits from a footcare product are protection against fungal infections (81.3%), elimination of foot odor (75%), and moisturizing and softening the skin (63.7%). Additionally, 91.3% of respondents prefer a single product that offers multiple benefits rather than separate products for each issue. The importance of scent was also highlighted, with 66.3% finding it either very or somewhat important. Awareness about the environmental impact of fungal creams was moderate, with 35% aware of their potential negative effects. Interestingly, while 31.3% would definitely pay extra for eco-friendly materials, the majority (62.5%) would consider it depending on the price. This indicates a strong demand for an all-in-one footcare solution with a focus on effectiveness, pleasant scent, and sustainability, as long as the price remains reasonable.</p>

                        <strong>4. Perceptions of Genetically Modified Bacteria in Footcare: </strong> From the survey results, we found that familiarity with genetically modified organisms (GMOs) is fairly balanced, with 32% of respondents being very familiar and 36.6% somewhat familiar with their use in biotechnology. Comfort with the idea of using GMOs in everyday applications, such as footcare, showed a split, with 30.2% feeling very comfortable, while 29.7% were somewhat comfortable. A notable 41.2% of respondents have previously used probiotic products, indicating some level of familiarity with beneficial bacteria.
                        Safety concerns topped the list, with 69.8% of participants worried about the potential risks to humans, followed by concerns about effectiveness (52.1%) and environmental impact (44.8%). Interestingly, the majority indicated that assurances of clinical safety (75%), regulatory certification (65.1%), and transparent product information (68.2%) would significantly increase their comfort levels in using footcare products containing GMOs. This indicates a clear need for educating consumers about the safety, efficacy, and sustainability of using GMOs in personal care products.

      <strong>1. Visit to Axis Bank Office, Theatre Road, AC Market, Kolkata, West Bengal</strong><br>
      As part of our iGEM project, we conducted interviews with corporate professionals in Kolkata to understand the challenges they face due to prolonged shoe-wearing as part of office discipline. During our visit to Axis Bank Office at Theatre Road, Kolkata, on June 29th, 2024, we engaged with bank officials who shared their experiences with foot health issues such as cracked skin, pain in the interdigital spaces, and fungal infections, which are common due to long hours of wearing closed shoes. Our discussions on foot care highlighted the potential benefits of a silica-based sole construction for preventing such problems. The officials expressed interest in our project and provided valuable insights through a survey, contributing to our understanding of the foot care challenges faced by professionals in corporate settings.

But wearing them all day isn’t ideal for foot health either.Fungal infections aren’t something I deal with often, but I know many people around here who suffer, especially during the colder months when it’s harder to keep your feet dry.I use foot powder and creams regularly. And if the weather is warmer, I switch to more breathable shoes, but that’s not always possible here.The real challenge is managing moisture—whether it’s snow or rain, your feet are always at risk of getting damp, which can cause infections if you’re not careful.</p>

          <p class="text-lg mb-4" style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">
              We had the opportunity to interview personnel from the Border Security Force (BSF) stationed at a camp near IISER-Kolkata, including a <strong>Deputy Commandant</strong> and a <strong>Quarter Commandant</strong>. The purpose of our visit was to gather insights into the footwear usage and foot health concerns of soldiers, as we initially believed that army personnel who wear shoes for extended periods would be our key stakeholders.
          </p>
      
          <h4 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-3" style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">Important Dialogue</h4>
      
          <p class="text-lg mb-4" style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">
              <strong>Deputy Commandant:</strong> In the first few months of training, it's quite common to see issues like boils, redness, and white discoloration on the feet. But over time, the body adjusts, and these problems tend to reduce.
          </p>
      
          <div class="flex items-start mb-6">
              <p class="font-semibold text-lg flex-1" style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">
                  During the discussion, the soldiers also revealed that they use different types of shoes for specific purposes. They shared insights about three key types: Jungle Boots, Combat Boots, and DMS (Direct Moulded Sole) Shoes.
              </p>
              <img src="https://static.igem.wiki/teams/5425/human-practices/img-20240925-143546-909-1.webp" class="w-1/3 h-auto ml-4 border-2 border-gray-300 rounded-lg">
          </div>
      
          <p class="text-lg mb-4" style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">
              <strong>Quarter Commandant:</strong> Jungle Boots are the most comfortable for long-range patrols. They're tough and breathable, perfect for rugged terrains, especially in Naxal areas where we might cover up to 30-40 kilometers in a single run.
          </p>
      
          <p class="text-lg font-semibold mb-4" style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">
              The conversation also revealed critical information about the challenges faced by soldiers in extreme climates. For instance, in colder regions like Siachen, moisture inside their shoes can freeze into ice crystals, causing severe damage to their feet. Similarly, in hot desert regions like Jaisalmer, soldiers often experience pale skin and boils due to trapped heat inside their shoes.
          </p>
      
          <p class="text-lg italic mb-4" style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">
              Soldier recently returned from the border: "Up in Siachen, the moisture in your boots actually freezes into ice. You can feel the crystals forming inside, and it gets so bad that some guys end up with frostbite. In the worst cases, we've even seen amputations because of it."
          </p>
      
          <p class="text-lg mb-4" style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">
              While soldiers have adapted well to their footwear in more moderate climates, we were surprised to learn that foot care is not formally addressed in their training or routine. Foot-related issues are generally regarded as minor, and only a few soldiers face these problems at any given time. However, the soldiers did stress the importance of <strong>insoles</strong> for added comfort.
          </p>
      
          <p class="text-lg italic mb-4" style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">
              "Insoles are key. They need to be thick and customized depending on the type of shoe we're wearing. It can make all the difference during long patrols."
          </p>
      
          <div class="flex items-start mb-6">
              <p class="text-lg flex-1 mb-4" style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">
                  From our discussion with BSF personnel, we learned that soldiers, especially during early training, face foot issues like boils and redness but eventually adapt to their footwear. Jungle Boots are preferred for their durability and breathability during long-range patrols in rugged terrains, while Combat Boots are less suited for extended wear, emphasizing the need for purpose-specific footwear. However, new recruits and those undergoing intensive training may still benefit from improved footwear options.
              </p>
              <img src="https://static.igem.wiki/teams/5425/human-practices/img-20240925-143422-570.webp" class="w-1/3 h-auto ml-4 border-2 border-gray-300 rounded-lg">
          </div>
      
          <p class="text-lg mb-4" style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">
              Foot health becomes a serious concern in extreme climates. In freezing areas like Siachen, moisture inside shoes can freeze, leading to frostbite and even amputations. In desert regions like Jaisalmer, trapped heat causes boils and skin discoloration. These issues highlight the need for footwear that manages moisture and temperature effectively in extreme environments.
          </p>
      
          <p class="text-lg mb-4" style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">
              Additionally, soldiers emphasized the importance of thick, customized insoles for long-duration missions. This feedback guided us in refining E. Solei by incorporating different strains of bacteria capable of withstanding extreme climatic conditions, particularly for those operating in high-altitude environments where foot health is most at risk. Additionally, we will need to focus on affordability and value, while broadening our perspective on potential stakeholders to ensure that our solution benefits a wider range of users.

          <p class="text-lg mb-4" style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">
              We had a discussion with Mr. Kaushal Sharma, the Chief Security Officer of our institute, about the challenges of long-term shoe wear, focusing on issues such as fungal and bacterial infections, unpleasant odors, and foot swelling. As a former army personnel, he shared the preventive measures he follows to maintain foot health.
          </p>
      
          <p class="text-lg italic mb-4" style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">
              Mr. Sharma: "One thing that struck me during our conversation is how the material you're developing for footwear could have a much broader application. Think about people who are bedridden in hospitals or at home for long periods. They’re unable to move, and the constant exposure of certain parts of their body to the bed surface often leads to fungal infections and sores. If you could adapt this antimicrobial material into something like a bedsheet or covering, it would be incredibly beneficial for preventing these kinds of infections. This could address a major issue in healthcare, helping patients stay healthier and more comfortable."
          </p>
      
          <p class="text-lg mb-4" style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">
              <strong>What We Learned:</strong> We learned the importance of strict hygiene practices to prevent foot-related issues in long-term shoe wear. Additionally, Mr. Sharma highlighted another potential application for <strong>E. Solei</strong> as an antimicrobial bed for bedridden patients in hospitals, where infections are a significant concern. This insight broadens the scope of our product to address a real-world problem in healthcare.

  <p class="text-lg mb-8">
      Our project focuses on two key components: the production of linalool—known for its antifungal, wound healing, antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, and lavender fragrance properties—and the sustained production of linalool using live bacterial cultures. We encountered a significant challenge in controlling the bacterial population to prevent overgrowth, which could compromise the product's longevity. To address this issue, we developed a population control module incorporating a sensing system to regulate bacterial growth, ensuring that the product remains effective over time.
