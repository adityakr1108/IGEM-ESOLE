        In a country as vast and varied as India, no one solution fits all. We quickly realized that to make our E. Solei project truly impactful, we needed to embrace the rich cultural, linguistic, and geographical diversity of the nation. 
        As one team member aptly put it, “Understanding the unique challenges faced by different regions is not just important—it’s essential for designing solutions that work for everyone.” 
        With this belief guiding us, we took deliberate steps to ensure our project was as inclusive and accessible as possible, reaching people across different states, languages, and socio-economic backgrounds.

    <p class="text-lg mt-6" style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">
        Understanding that foot health varies across environments, we expanded our interviews to different states in India to capture regional challenges. These insights allowed us to tailor our solutions to the specific needs of each region.

            <p>"I wear shoes for around 12 hours at the airport, and due to the climate in Kerala, I often experience foot infections. My dermatologist said it's likely caused by wearing wet socks. These types of fungal infections have become more frequent since the COVID outbreak. Although I’ve been using medication, the infection hasn’t fully cleared up, and I often forget to apply it regularly."</p>

            <p>"The climate in Kerala is generally pleasant, with about six months of rainy season and six months of moderate summer. I usually wear slippers, but during farming, I often remove them. Foot infections are common, especially during the rainy season when my feet are exposed to muddy water and bacteria from fertilizers. I don’t usually seek medical treatment, instead relying on traditional remedies like liquid from burnt cashew nuts. Antifungal creams are not popular because they take too long to work."</p>

            <p>"Because of Kerala’s climate, I usually wear sandals, but shoes are mandatory for school. I wear them for about 6 hours daily. In 3rd grade, I had black patches on my feet, which were itchy and lasted for about a year before I sought treatment. I used red potassium crystals dissolved in warm water to soak my feet. It was effective but time-consuming. I experienced this more during the rainy season."</p>

I usually wear sandals, especially during the rainy season, but I’ve experienced foot infections during my school days, particularly in the rainy months. The infections caused itching between my toes when I wore shoes. I had to frequently visit the doctor and use ointments, but maintaining foot health can be challenging, especially with the warm and wet conditions here."</p>

            <p>"I've been dealing with a fungal infection for the last 10 years, and it gets much worse every winter. It's more manageable during the rainy season and decreases in summer. I get rashes, skin cuts, and peeling, and it feels really itchy—sometimes even bleeding. When it dries, black spots appear where I scratched. This all started after I moved to Ahmedabad. Back in Dabhoi, where the weather was cooler, I didn't have these problems. To manage it, I wear socks and apply petroleum jelly, but when my feet get wet and then dry, the itching gets worse. As you can see, the skin turns black after scratching, and there's swelling in some spots."

    <h2 class="text-4xl font-bold text-center">Understanding Athletes' Footwear Needs: Insights from Coaches and Athletes</h2>
    <p class="text-lg mt-6" style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">
        In our quest to make our project truly inclusive, we turned our attention to athletes—individuals whose feet bear the brunt of immense strain and pressure on a daily basis. To dive deeper into the crucial role that footwear plays in their lives, we held insightful interviews with three seasoned athletic coaches from football, badminton, and kabaddi, along with various athletes from Maharaja Bhupinder Singh University in Patiala.
    </p>
    <p class="text-lg mt-6" style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">
        These discussions revealed just how vital proper footwear is—not just for performance, but for injury prevention and long-term foot health. For athletes pushing their physical limits day in and day out, the right footwear can make all the difference. Hearing firsthand about their experiences and needs helped us better understand the importance of tailored foot care for those who rely on their feet to achieve greatness. This has played a key role in shaping our project to ensure it caters to the unique demands of both athletes and active individuals.

    <p class="text-lg mt-6" style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">
        As part of our inclusivity efforts, we believe that education should be accessible to everyone, especially those with limited resources. To achieve this, we partnered with the Ek Pehel initiative at IISER Kolkata, which focuses on educating children from underprivileged backgrounds.
    </p>
    <p class="text-lg mt-6" style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">
        Through this collaboration, we introduced these eager young minds to the exciting world of synthetic biology. By conducting hands-on activities and interactive lessons, we made science both fun and accessible, aiming to ignite their curiosity and inspire a passion for learning. This experience reinforced our belief in the power of education to break barriers and open new opportunities for all.

    <p class="text-lg mt-6" style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">
        Recognizing India's vast linguistic diversity, we made sure our project was accessible to a broader audience by translating our survey questions into four regional languages—Kashmiri, Malayalam, Bengali, Punjabi, and Gujarati. By offering the survey in these languages, we ensured that participants could engage with our research comfortably in their native tongue.
    </p>
    <p class="text-lg mt-6" style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">
        This effort not only promoted inclusivity but also allowed us to gather more accurate, region-specific insights, reflecting the unique needs and challenges of diverse communities across the country.

    <p class="text-lg mt-6" style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">
        As part of our inclusivity efforts, during Pride Month, we took to Instagram to highlight the remarkable contributions and inspiring stories of individuals from the LGBTQ+ community in the world of science. Through these posts, we aimed to celebrate diversity within the scientific community and raise awareness about the pivotal role LGBTQ+ scientists have played in driving innovation and discovery.
    </p>
    <p class="text-lg mt-6" style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">
