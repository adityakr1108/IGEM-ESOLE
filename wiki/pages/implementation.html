        <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-6">
          <li><strong>Preparation of Competent Cells:</strong> Using established techniques, competent E. coli cells are prepared as the first step. We have employed the TFB1, TFB2, and CaCl2-RbCl technique. The electroporation technique might improve the cells' capacity to absorb exogenous plasmid DNA, which is essential for a satisfactory transformation.</li>
          <li><strong>Cotransformation:</strong>After competent cells are prepared, two different plasmids are to be concurrently injected into the competent cells using a cotransformation technique. To increase the absorption efficiency, the plasmid concentrations and ratios must be optimised.</li>
          <li><strong>Selection and Screening:</strong> After transformation, cells are plated on media that are specifically designed to withstand the antibiotics that match the resistance genes expressed in the plasmids. Effective colonies are selected using molecular methods.</li>
          <li><strong>Small-Scale Cultivation:</strong> Positive colonies are to be inoculated into small liquid cultures (e.g., LB broth supplemented with antibiotics) to facilitate further growth and analysis of the transformed E. coli strains.</li>

        <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Bulk-Level Production Strategies with <em>Lactobacillus rhamnosus</em></h3>
        <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-6">
          <li><strong>Scale-Up of Competent Cells:</strong> For bulk production, large-scale cultures of Lactobacillus rhamnosus are to be grown to high cell densities prior to competency induction. Fermentation techniques may be employed to optimise growth conditions, including control over nutrient availability, pH (very slightly acidic conditions optimises growth), and aeration.</li>
          <li><strong>Co-transformation in Bioreactors:</strong> The co-transformation process can be conducted in bioreactors, allowing for greater control over environmental parameters. Optimization of mixing and oxygenation is crucial to ensure effective plasmid uptake by the competent cells.</li>
          <li><strong>High-Throughput Screening:</strong> Implementing high-throughput screening methodologies enables rapid identification and isolation of transformed colonies. Automated systems for colony picking and subsequent PCR validation can significantly enhance efficiency and throughput.</li>
          <li><strong>Cryopreservation:</strong> Upon successful transformation and growth, transformed Lactobacillus rhamnosus strains can be subjected to cryopreservation techniques to ensure long-term viability and plasmid stability. This process facilitates the preservation of the genetic constructs for future applications.</li>
          <li><strong>Scale-Up Culture Conditions:</strong> Optimising culture media (without peptone but containing glucose and skim milk powder) and growth conditions (e.g., temperature, slightly acidic pH, agitation) within larger fermenters is essential for maximising the yield of the transformed Lactobacillus rhamnosus. Continuous monitoring of growth parameters is recommended to maintain optimal conditions. Also new techniques like semi-solid fermentation (SSF) can be deployed to achieve high cell density populations of the chassis.</li>
          <li><strong>Quality Control:</strong> Comprehensive quality control measures should be implemented at various stages of production, including assessments of plasmid stability and gene expression levels. Techniques such as restriction enzyme analysis and sequencing may be employed to verify the integrity of the transformed constructs.</li>

            <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Choice of Polymer</h3>
            <p>You look around right now, sir and almost everything you set eyes on or touch, from your toothbrush bristles, to the pen you are holding, is made from a polymer. A few words on polymers? They are large compounds made of repeating units called monomers. Some naturally-occurring polymers include cellulose, natural rubber, etc. In this world of dynamically changing industries polymer forms the basis of many a one, including textiles, food, etc. and it forms an integral part of our project E.solei as well.</p>
        
            <p>Our GMO is designed to sustain itself in a bio-compatible polymer, which would contain the nutrients necessary to promote normal physiological growth of the GMO and subsequently linalool production.</p>
            
            <p>We propose an alginate-collagen brush polymer for housing our GMO, a <em>Lactobacillus rhamnosus</em> species, which has excellent binding properties to the surface of polymers, because of its distinguished hydrophobicity. The biopolymer, during its manufacture, is infused with nutrients required to keep the bacteria growing and producing the compound Linalool. Of course, the choice of polymer is kept with cost in mind, with it being one of the cheapest available materials.</p><br><br>

            <h4 class="text-lg font-bold mb-2">Alginate and its Suitable Properties</h4>
            <p>Alginate is a hydrocolloid from algae, specifically brown algae, which is a group that includes many of the seaweeds, like kelps and an extracellular polymer of some bacteria. Sodium alginate is one of the best-known members of the hydrogel group.</p>
            
            <p>Alginate is biocompatible, biodegradable and non-toxic, has high biosafety and undergoes rapid ionic gelation, is nutritious to bacteria and therefore makes up an ideal composition for the matrix.</p>
    
            <h4 class="text-lg font-bold mb-2">Collagen, Chitosan and their Roles</h4>
            <p>Ionically cross-linked alginate hydrogels have the disadvantages of insufficient mechanical properties and long-term stability owing to ion-exchange.</p>
            
            <p>Here collagen and other stable materials such as chitosan come into play. Collagen, the most abundant protein in our body, can be used in combination with alginate in the form of a hydrogel. This collagen-alginate polymer increases the mechanical stability and use of fish collagen also further reduces swelling.</p>
            <p>Alginate also shows pH sensitivity and might degrade at very low pH("<4>") Even though our foot environment seldom registers pH levels below 4, we can increase the robustness of alginate towards a low pH condition, by mixing chitosan with it</p>

        <!-- Use of Brush Polymers Section -->
            <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Use of Brush Polymers</h3>
            <p>A polymer brush is the name given to a surface coating consisting of polymers tethered to a surface. These polymer layers can be tethered to flat substrates such as silicon wafers, or highly curved substrates such as nano-particles. Also, polymers can be tethered in high density to another single polymer chain, although this arrangement is normally named a bottle brush.</p>
            <p>The brushes are often characterised by the high density of grafted chains. The limited space then leads to a strong extension of the chains. Grafting polymers to a surface to form a polymer brush is often performed to create coatings, as polymer brushes favourably modulate bacteria.</p>
            <p>We propose to use a similar brush polymer made from alginate-collagen composition, to whose brush-like extensions our GMO will adhere due to its surface hydrophobicity.</p>

        <!-- Adherence of GMO Section -->
        <section class="bg-gray-100 p-4 mb-6 rounded-lg">
            <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Adherence of GMO</h3>
            <p>Our GMO, <em>Lactobacillus rhamnosus</em>, has high hydrophobicity due to the composition of its cell surface, which includes the occurrence of hydrophobic amino acids, polysaccharides. Due to increased hydrophobicity it can easily adhere to the bristles of the brush polymer.</p>
            <p><strong>State of GMO:</strong> The GMO is lyophilised and then attached to the surface of the bristles. This is primarily done to ensure dormancy till the point the user opens the encasing and uses the product. This causes no wastage of either product or resources (both bacterial and nutrient).</p>

            <p>The product comes packaged in two layers: Layer 1 and Layer 2, with a similar brush polymer and lyophilised bacteria adhered to the surface. Both the layers come packaged in a porous casing, with a pore size such that it does not let the GMO to pass through but allows free diffusion of our target molecule Linalool.</p>
            <p>Before the usage, the encasing is removed from top. An inducer medium is sprayed on top of the layers. This revives the bacterium from its lyophilised state so that it carries on a normal life cycle henceforth. Now layer 1 is inverted and placed face down on layer 2 and both the layers are covered by the encasing. This complete bi-layer is now placed inside the shoe sole.</p>

            <p>Distributing E.solei foot insoles requires special care to preserve the genetically modified <em>Lactobacillus rhamnosus</em> bacteria inside. This is where cold-chain logistics come in, maintaining an ideal temperature of around 4°C from production to delivery. Each insole package has a temperature indicator, ensuring consumers can trust that their product hasn't been exposed to damaging conditions.</p>
    
            <p>To make the process convenient, a Direct-to-Consumer (D2C) model allows customers to purchase insoles online and receive them via temperature-controlled delivery. A subscription service further ensures regular, fresh deliveries without hassle.</p>
    
            <p>Additionally, pharmacies, specialised health stores, and healthcare providers like podiatrists will offer the insoles, leveraging their experience in handling temperature-sensitive products. International distribution will also meet local GMO regulations, with reliable regional partnerships ensuring safe, compliant delivery.</p>
    
            <p>Through these tailored distribution strategies, E.solei foot insoles arrive fresh and ready to support your foot health, no matter where or how you choose to buy them.</p>

            <h4 class="text-xl font-bold mb-2">Perspective 1: Alginate</h4>
            <p>As suggested in the packing section, the hosting material of the product will be composed of Alginate, a hydrocolloid obtained majorly from brown algae. It is non-toxic to tissues and cells, hence no possible harm by skin contact on accidental exposure to the broken product cassette. Alginate can be degraded by exposure to high temperature (above 250°C), and the alginate matrix can be dismantled by cation chelation. Recyclability is ensured by the pH control of the chelator.</p>
    
            <!-- Perspective 2: Collagen and Chitosan -->
            <h4 class="text-xl font-bold mb-2">Perspective 2: Collagen and Chitosan</h4>
            <p>Collagen, being a major structural component of most animals, is completely biodegradable. Collagen is made with three different polypeptide chains forming a particular structure to perform certain physiological activities. Hence, collagen is degraded by enzymatic degradation. It has no harmful effect on exposure to animals or humans.</p>
            <p>Chitosan, on the other hand, is a biopolymer profoundly used for its biodegradability and low toxicity. It is also degraded by lysozyme enzyme exposure. Research shows that chitosan is degraded into non-toxic residues more quickly in the soil. Additionally, it is not harmful to animals or humans.</p>

            <p>Brush polymers are composed of several polymer chains in a specific organization to perform the desired function. These are recycled by exposure to high temperature, degraded by the action of microorganisms, and are eco-friendly, which is why they have diverse biomedical applications.</p>
    
            <!-- Perspective 4: Lactobacillus rhamnosus -->
            <h4 class="text-xl font-bold mb-2">Perspective 4: Lactobacillus rhamnosus</h4>
            <p>The large group of <em>Lactobacillus</em> is considered harmless to humans as well as animals. Moreover, <em>Lactobacillus rhamnosus</em> is a probiotic bacteria. A probiotic bacteria is safe for even human consumption in forms of drugs, so there will be no harm to the environment in case of accidental release of the GMO.</p>
            <p>Besides, our proposed kill-switch machinery adds extra safety to the user by turning on the automated killing of the bacteria upon detachment from its substrate. Moreover, as our GMO comes in a lyophilized form, it is inactive until the activation of the product by spraying media onto it. Hence, any unintentional release or breakage of the product before use will not cause any harm to the surroundings or users. In its lyophilized form, the bacteria can be stored for a long time.</p>
