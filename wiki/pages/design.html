              <h1 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Strategic Design</h1>
              <p class="mb-4">Our objective is to engineer a living microbial system for use in foot care, embedded in a nutritive foot-bed. This innovative approach aims to solve common foot care issues that people experience daily, such as fungal infections, inflammation, and odor. By leveraging the ability of genetically engineered bacteria to continuously produce a beneficial compound, we aim to create a solution that goes beyond traditional creams and ointments.
             <br>Specifically, we aim to use bacteria that produce linalool, our target compound, a naturally occurring molecule found in plant-based oils. Linalool offers multiple properties that align with foot-care: it is anti-fungal, anti- inflammatory, fragrant, and non-toxic. The living microbial system will be embedded within a nutritive foot-bed, allowing the genetically modified bacterium to use the substrate to sustain itself, produce and release linalool, which will diffuse throughout the foot environment.
          </p>
              
              <h2 class="text-xl font-bold mt-4 mb-2">Live Application of Engineered Bacteria</h2>
              <p class="mb-4">In contrast to conventional treatments that require frequent application, our approach integrates a living microbial system into a nutritive foot-bed, turning it into a long-term care solution. This foot bed is designed to fit into any shoe, where the bacteria embedded in the foot-bed use the nutrients within the foot-bed substrate to synthesize and secrete linalool over an extended period.</p>
              
              <h2 class="text-xl font-bold mt-4 mb-2">Why Use a Living Microbial System in the first place?</h2>
              <p class="mb-4">The advantage of using a living microbial system is that it provides continuous, self-sustaining production of therapeutic molecules. By housing bacteria in a contained and controlled environment within the foot-bed, the system can deliver round-the-clock foot care. Instead of relying on externally applied products that wear off after a few hours, the living microbial system ensures that fresh linalool is produced as long as the foot-bed is in use, forming an intrinsic part of the foot environment with time.</p>
              
              <h2 class="text-xl font-bold mt-4 mb-2">Linalool: The Perfect Foot Care Molecule</h2>
              <p class="mb-4">Linalool is a naturally occurring terpene alcohol found in many plants, such as lavender and coriander.It was specifically chosen for this project because of its multifaceted properties:
              </p>
              <ul class="list-disc ml-8 mb-4">
                  <li><strong>Anti-inflammatory and Antifungal Properties:</strong> Linalool has been shown to reduce inflammation, making it particularly effective in soothing irritated skin. Its antifungal activity can help manage common foot-related conditions, such as Athleteâ€™s Foot.</li>
                  <li><strong>Fragrance and Non-toxicity:</strong> As a pleasant-smelling and non-toxic compound, linalool adds a fragrance to the foot-bed, improving the user experience, battling with bad-odour, a long-standing source of inconvenience and embarrassment.</li>
                  <li><strong>Easy Diffusion: </strong>One of the key benefits of linalool is its volatile nature, allowing it to escape easily from the nutritive foot-bed and disperse throughout the shoe. This diffusion ensures that the entire foot is exposed to the compound, allowing it to reach the crevices and inter-digital spaces which are not otherwise reached by a foot-cream providing continuous protection and skin care.</li>

              </p>
              <p class="mb-4">By creating a living ecosystem, this foot-bed offers a longer-lasting solution compared to topical applications, which are either washed off or worn away. Importantly, this system requires minimal user intervention, making it a hassle-free foot care solution.</p>
              
              <h2 class="text-xl font-bold mt-4 mb-2">Choosing the chassis</h2>
              <p class="mb-4">Why is <em>Lactobacillus rhamnosus</em> an ideal candidate for the foot-bed application for our iGEM project?</p>
              <ol class="list-decimal ml-8 mb-4">
                  <li><strong>Safety and Probiotic Nature:</strong> <em>Lactobacillus rhamnosus</em> is a well-established probiotic, commonly found in the gut and known for its safe use in various health applications. It has a proven track record in human-related treatments without causing harm, even when used in delicate environments like the gastrointestinal and urogenital tracts. This makes it a suitable candidate for integration into a nutritive foot-bed, minimizing the risk of harm if it comes into contact with skin or accidental exposure.</li>
                  <li><strong>Antifungal and Antimicrobial Properties:</strong> <em>Lactobacillus rhamnosus</em> is known for producing antimicrobial compounds like 3-phenyllactic acid, which exhibit strong antifungal properties. This aligns with the production of linalool, a compound with antifungal and anti-inflammatory properties, thereby complementing it and enhancing the foot-bed's efficacy in managing skin health and preventing fungal infections.</li>
                  <li><strong>Robustness and Skin Microbiome Compatibility:</strong> This species of <em>Lactobacillus</em> is resilient in various conditions, including acidic environments and bile salts, which makes it adaptable for the relatively dynamic environment of a foot-bed. It can also support the skinâ€™s natural microbiome by outcompeting harmful pathogens without disrupting the overall microbial balance, which is critical in preventing skin irritation or infections.</li>
                  <li><strong>Immunomodulatory Potential:</strong> <em>Lactobacillus rhamnosus</em> has been shown to have immunomodulatory effects, potentially aiding in reducing inflammation and improving skin health. Its presence can help maintain a healthy immune response on the skin, adding an additional layer of protection against pathogens.</li>
              </ol>
              <p class="mb-4">Thus we take home the fact that Lactobacillus rhamnosus provides a package of safe antimicrobial action, and skin- compatible properties, making it an ideal candidate for use in a live microbial system in the foot-bed designed to release therapeutic molecules such as linalool and manage skin conditions.
                  Further details can be extracted from discussions on Microbial Cell Factories and Applied Microbiology and Biotechnology.
                  For our project, the team carries out all experiments in Escherichia coli (BL21 and DH5- alpha strains) as chassis, which are to be replicated when the chassis is changed to Lactobacillus rhamnosus.

              <ul class="list-disc ml-8 mb-4">
                  <li>Use of Non-Pathogenic Strains: The bacteria selected, <em>Lactobacillus rhamnosus</em>, is a safe probiotic strain that is non-pathogenic and commonly found in the human microbiome. It minimizes health risks while performing the desired function in the footbed.</li>
                  <li>Physical Barrier Between Footbed and Environment: The footbed is designed with a physical barrier separating it from the external environment. This barrier ensures that bacteria remain contained within the footbed and prevents any unintended release of microbes into the surroundings, providing an additional layer of safety.</li>
                  <li>Auxotrophy for Safety: The bacteria are engineered to be auxotrophic, making them dependent on specific nutrients provided by the footbed media. This ensures that the bacteria cannot survive or proliferate outside the controlled environment of the footbed, reducing the risk of environmental contamination.</li>
                  <li>Minimalist Cell Design: The bacterial cells are genetically streamlined, only containing the essential components necessary for producing beneficial compounds like linalool. This reduces the risk of unforeseen genetic interactions or behaviors.</li>
                  <li>Kill Switch: The living microbial system incorporates a kill switch, ensuring the bacteria can be safely deactivated or killed under specific conditions, such as environmental exposure or the end of the productâ€™s lifespan, or detachment from the media layer.</li>
                  <li>Safe Disposal Methods: Disposal protocols are put in place to neutralize any remaining bacterial activity and prevent live bacteria from escaping into the environment after the footbed has been used.</li>
                  <li>Controlled Population Growth: The bacterial population within the footbed is regulated through a quorum sensing mechanism, controlling cell division and preventing overpopulation. This control minimizes the risks of nutrient depletion, toxic metabolite buildup, and overgrowth.</li>
                  <li>Dependence on Footbed Media: Due to their auxotrophic nature, the bacteria are reliant on the nutritive footbed media for survival, which means they cannot propagate outside the footbed. This makes the microbial system self-limiting and enhances its biosafety.</li>

              <h2 class="text-xl font-bold mt-4 mb-2">Addressing Major Problems with Living Bio-Material Therapeutics</h2>
<img src="https://static.igem.wiki/teams/5425/drylab/population-with-qs.webp" alt="Population Control Visualization" class="max-w-xs my-4">
<p class="mb-4">When integrating living microbial systems into applications such as a nutritive footbed, several inherent issues related to population control and environmental sustainability are encountered. Without proper mechanisms to manage bacterial growth, these systems can quickly become inefficient due to factors like:</p>
<ul class="list-disc ml-8 mb-4">
<li><strong>Uncontrolled Population Growth:</strong> Bacteria in a nutrient-rich medium can rapidly proliferate, leading to overpopulation which overwhelms the mediumâ€™s capacity and causes rapid nutrient depletion.</li>
<li><strong>Nutrient Depletion:</strong> As bacterial numbers increase, they consume the available resources within the medium faster than it can be replenished, resulting in a shorter functional lifespan for the microbial system.</li>
<li><strong>Toxic Metabolite Buildup:</strong> Excessive bacterial growth leads to the accumulation of metabolic byproducts which, without regulation, can become toxic to the bacteria themselves, ultimately reducing the system's overall efficacy.</li>
<li><strong>Loss of Stability:</strong> Overcrowded bacterial populations experience stress from competition for limited resources, leading to decreased productivity and failure to produce the desired compounds like linalool.</li>
</ul>
<p class="mb-4">Our solution to the bacterial population problem in the footbed involves a dynamic system that intelligently automates itself and controls bacterial growth to maintain a stable and healthy population. This system ensures the bacteria never overgrow, which could lead to the accumulation of harmful byproducts, or die off too quickly, reducing their beneficial effects. By periodically pausing their ability to multiply, the system prevents the bacteria from exceeding the capacity of their environment. This controlled population management extends the lifespan of the footbed by preserving the nutrients in the media and allowing the bacteria to continuously produce beneficial compounds like linalool over an extended period.</p>
<img src="https://static.igem.wiki/teams/5425/drylab/population-with-qs.webp" alt="Dynamic System Visualization" class="max-w-xs my-4">
<h3 class="text-lg font-bold mt-4 mb-2">Traffic Police Analogy and Project Phases</h3>
<ul class="list-disc ml-8 mb-4">
<li><strong>Phase 1: Design and Proof of Concept</strong> - Design and incorporate population regulation model, characterize it, develop initial kill switch mechanism, and test bacteria for proof of concept in the lab.</li>
<li><strong>Phase 2: System Integration</strong> - Finalize kill switch, co-transform population and linalool circuits, synthesize and optimize media for bacterial growth, and conduct small-scale tests for population control and linalool production.</li>
<li><strong>Phase 3: Live Testing</strong> - Conduct live testing in real-world conditions, measure population stability and linalool production, test kill switch and safety mechanisms, and refine system based on test data.</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="text-xl font-bold mt-4 mb-2">System Design</h2>
<p class="mb-4">Our bacterial population control circuit is designed around three key modules: the Sensing Module, Execution Module, and Regulation Module. These components work together to monitor bacterial population levels, control growth through cell cycle arrest, and regulate this growth to keep the population stable and healthy. This approach helps to avoid overpopulation, extend bacterial lifespan, and prevent the accumulation of toxic byproducts.</p>
<h3 class="text-lg font-bold mt-4 mb-2">Sensing Module (Quorum Sensing-Based Population Detection)</h3>
<p class="mb-4">The Sensing Module detects bacterial population size using a quorum sensing mechanism. As bacteria grow, they produce an autoinducer molecule called AHL (N-acyl homoserine lactone) via the enzyme LuxI. The AHL concentration rises with the bacterial population. When it hits a critical level, AHL binds to the LuxR transcription factor inside the bacteria. This binding causes AHL-LuxR complexes to dimerize, and these dimers pair up to form tetramers. These tetramers then bind to specific DNA sequences known as lux boxes, located upstream of the plux promoter. This binding activates the plux promoter, leading to the expression of genes in the Execution and Regulation modules, linking bacterial population size directly to gene expression.</p>
<h3 class="text-lg font-bold mt-4 mb-2">Execution Module (Cell Cycle Arrest for Population Control)</h3>
<p class="mb-4">The Execution Module controls bacterial growth once the population hits a preset threshold. This is achieved through the expression of a cell cycle arrest gene (cca) located downstream of the plux promoter. When enough AHL is produced, the plux promoter activates, leading to the expression of cca. The cca gene causes a halt in cell division across the bacterial population, preventing further growth.</p>
<h3 class="text-lg font-bold mt-4 mb-2">Regulation Module (Recovery and Modulation of Population Growth)</h3>
<p class="mb-4">The Regulation Module adds reversibility and fine control over the bacterial population. After triggering cell cycle arrest, the system allows periodic recovery to maintain a healthy population. This module features two negative feedback loops to manage AHL levels and modulate population control. TetR Control of AHL Production: To prevent continuous AHL production and indefinite population arrest, we regulate the luxI gene (responsible for AHL production) under the ptet promoter. TetR, a repressor protein, binds to the ptet promoter, blocking luxI expression and halting further AHL production. AHL Degradation by AiiA: We also need to remove existing AHL to allow recovery. The enzyme AiiA degrades AHL in the media. Weâ€™ve added a degradation tag to AiiA to ensure it breaks down AHL only as long as needed. As bacteria die and AHL is degraded, its concentration drops. When AHL falls below the critical threshold, LuxR dissociates from the plux promoter, stopping the expression of cca, TetR, and AiiA. This ends cell cycle arrest and allows the population to recover and grow.</p>
<h3 class="text-lg font-bold mt-4 mb-2">Cyclic Control and Population Oscillations</h3>
<p class="mb-4">Together, these modules create a dynamic system that oscillates between growth and arrest phases, keeping the bacterial population stable. Negative feedback loops ensure that when the population becomes too large, cell cycle arrest is triggered. As cells die and AHL levels drop, the population can recover and resume growth. This cyclical behavior keeps the population healthy and functional without depleting resources. The frequency and amplitude of these oscillations depend on parameters like AHL production and degradation rates, as well as the effectiveness of the arrest and recovery mechanisms. By fine-tuning these parameters, we can maintain a stable bacterial density that supports continuous linalool production while avoiding uncontrolled growth.</p>

  <img src="https://static.igem.wiki/teams/5425/drylab/population-with-qs.webp" alt="Population Control Visualization" class="max-w-full my-4">
  <p>
      When integrating living microbial systems into applications such as a nutritive footbed, several inherent issues related to population control and environmental sustainability arise. Without proper mechanisms to manage bacterial growth, these systems can quickly become inefficient due to several factors:
  </p>
  <ul class="list-disc ml-8 mb-4">
      <li><strong>Uncontrolled Population Growth:</strong> Bacteria in a nutrient-rich medium can rapidly proliferate, leading to overpopulation. This unchecked growth overwhelms the mediumâ€™s capacity, causing rapid nutrient depletion.</li>
      <li><strong>Nutrient Depletion:</strong> As bacterial numbers increase, they consume the available resources within the medium faster than it can be replenished. This results in a shorter functional lifespan for the microbial system.</li>
      <li><strong>Toxic Metabolite Buildup:</strong> Excessive bacterial growth leads to the accumulation of metabolic byproducts. Without regulation, these byproducts can become toxic to the bacteria themselves, ultimately reducing the system's overall efficacy.</li>
      <li><strong>Loss of Stability:</strong> Overcrowded bacterial populations experience stress from competition for limited resources. This stress can lead to decreased productivity and failure to produce the desired compounds, such as linalool in the footbed application.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
      These challenges highlight the key limitations of using living microbial systems in practical, long-term applications.
  </p>
  <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mt-4 mb-2">Facing the Challenges</h3>
  <p>
      Our solution to the bacterial population problem in the footbed involves a dynamic system that intelligently automates itself and controls bacterial growth to maintain a stable and healthy population. This system ensures the bacteria never overgrow, which could lead to the accumulation of harmful byproducts, or die off too quickly, which would reduce their beneficial effects. By periodically pausing their ability to multiply, the system prevents the bacteria from exceeding the capacity of their environment. This controlled population management extends the lifespan of the footbed by preserving the nutrients in the media and allowing the bacteria to continuously produce beneficial compounds, like linalool, over an extended period. This way, we create a sustainable, safe, and efficient solution that supports long-term foot care without the need for frequent replacements or interventions.

          <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
              Our bacterial population control circuit is designed around three key modules: the Sensing Module, Execution Module, and Regulation Module. These components work together to monitor bacterial population levels, control growth through cell cycle arrest, and regulate this growth to keep the population stable and healthy. This approach helps to avoid overpopulation, extend bacterial lifespan, and prevent the accumulation of toxic byproducts.
          </p>
          
          <!-- Sensing Module -->
          <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-6 mb-2">1. Sensing Module (Quorum Sensing-Based Population Detection)</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
              The Sensing Module detects bacterial population size using a quorum sensing mechanism. As bacteria grow, they produce an autoinducer molecule called AHL (N-acyl homoserine lactone) via the enzyme LuxI. The AHL concentration rises with the bacterial population. When it hits a critical level, AHL binds to the LuxR transcription factor inside the bacteria.
          </p>
          <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
              This binding causes AHL-LuxR complexes to dimerize, and these dimers pair up to form tetramers. These tetramers then bind to specific DNA sequences known as lux boxes, located upstream of the plux promoter. This binding activates the plux promoter, leading to the expression of genes in the Execution and Regulation modules. Essentially, this module links bacterial population size directly to gene expression. More bacteria mean more AHL, and once the threshold is reached, the gene expression cascade kicks in.
          </p>

          <!-- Execution Module -->
          <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-6 mb-2">2. Execution Module (Cell Cycle Arrest for Population Control)</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
              The Execution Module controls bacterial growth once the population hits a preset threshold. This is achieved through the expression of a cell cycle arrest gene (cca) located downstream of the plux promoter. When enough AHL is produced, the plux promoter activates, leading to the expression of cca.
          </p>
          <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
              The cca gene causes a halt in cell division across the bacterial population, preventing further growth. This is crucial because unchecked growth could lead to nutrient depletion and the buildup of toxic byproducts, reducing linalool production efficiency.
          </p>
          <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
              To explain our choice of the cell cycle arrest gene: Antisense against dnaA. Why antisense? Steric Blocking Antisense Technology involves using antisense RNA to inhibit gene expression by binding to target mRNA, preventing translation. This technique gained traction in the 1990s, paving the way for therapeutic applications in genetic disorders.
          </p>

          <!-- Regulation Module -->
          <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-6 mb-2">3. Regulation Module (Recovery and Modulation of Population Growth)</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
              The Regulation Module adds reversibility and fine control over the bacterial population. After triggering cell cycle arrest, the system allows periodic recovery to maintain a healthy population. This module features two negative feedback loops to manage AHL levels and modulate population control: TetR Control of AHL Production and AHL Degradation by AiiA.
          </p>
          <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
              We also need to remove existing AHL to allow recovery. The enzyme AiiA degrades AHL in the media. Weâ€™ve added a degradation tag to AiiA to ensure it breaks down AHL only as long as needed. This way, AHL concentrations decrease once the population is arrested.

          <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-6 mb-2">4. Cyclic Control and Population Oscillations</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
              Together, these modules create a dynamic system that oscillates between growth and arrest phases, keeping the bacterial population stable. Negative feedback loops ensure that when the population becomes too large, cell cycle arrest is triggered. As cells die and AHL levels drop, the population can recover and resume growth. This cyclical behavior keeps the population healthy and functional without depleting resources. The frequency and amplitude of these oscillations depend on parameters like AHL production and degradation rates, as well as the effectiveness of the arrest and recovery mechanisms. By fine-tuning these parameters, we can maintain a stable bacterial density that supports continuous linalool production while avoiding uncontrolled growth.

          <p class="mb-4">
              The concept of embedding engineered bacteria into a nutritive footbed aims to create a system where the bacteria can continuously produce and release linalool, a compound with antifungal and anti-inflammatory properties. For this to work, several key aspects must be validated. First, bacterial viability will be tested by embedding the bacteria in the footbed material and measuring their growth and activity over time to ensure they can survive and thrive in this environment. This is essential to maintain long-term production of linalool.
          </p>
          <p class="mb-4">
              Next, the bacteria must be able to produce and release linalool consistently. Experiments will confirm the presence of linalool biosynthesis genes and use gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) to measure linalool production over time. Additionally, diffusion tests will be conducted to ensure linalool is evenly distributed across the footbed. These experiments will validate that the engineered bacteria can effectively perform their designed functions in a real-world setting, while population control mechanisms, such as quorum sensing, will regulate bacterial growth to avoid overgrowth and ensure safe, stable operation.

          <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-4 mb-2">Proof of Concept for Antisense mRNA Knockdown</h3>
          <p class="mb-4">
              Antisense mRNA technology is a well-established method for gene silencing, where an mRNA molecule complementary to a target mRNA binds to it, preventing translation. For the knockdown of the dnaA gene in E. coli, which is critical for initiating DNA replication, an antisense mRNA was designed to bind specifically to dnaA transcripts, thereby reducing its protein levels. Several studies have demonstrated the efficacy of antisense RNA in bacteria. In the context of our project, the antisense mRNA will be cloned into a plasmid under an inducible promoter. Upon induction, the antisense mRNA will bind to dnaA mRNA, inhibiting its translation and thereby downregulating DNA replication. The reduction in dnaA levels will be confirmed by Western blotting or quantitative RT-PCR. This knockdown approach is expected to help control cell proliferation as part of the broader population control system in our project.

          <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-4 mb-2">Proof of Concept for Choosing dnaA as a Cell Cycle Arrest Protein</h3>
          <p class="mb-4">
              In our project, we have selected dnaA as the target protein for inducing cell cycle arrest due to its critical role in the initiation of DNA replication in Escherichia coli. The functionality of dnaA is well-documented; it is essential for the timely and accurate initiation of chromosomal replication. Previous studies have demonstrated that the downregulation or inactivation of dnaA effectively halts DNA replication, providing a mechanism to regulate bacterial growth under various environmental stresses, such as energy depletion and nutrient limitation. Specifically, Godefroid Charbon and colleagues found that energy starvation leads to the arrest of chromosomal replication in E. coli, primarily mediated through the downregulation of dnaA. Additionally, Li et al. constructed temperature-sensitive mutants of dnaA in Streptomyces, demonstrating that these mutants can be synchronized to induce cell cycle arrest at specific temperatures, which highlights the potential of manipulating dnaA in bacterial systems for controlled growth regulation. This synchronization allows for precise control over bacterial populations, providing a platform for studying cell cycle dynamics under different conditions. By harnessing the regulatory mechanisms of dnaA, our project aims to implement a precise control system for bacterial population management, ensuring that the engineered bacteria can maintain an optimal population density while minimizing the risk of toxic byproduct accumulation.

          <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-4 mb-2">Proof of Concept for Quorum Sensing Math Model</h3>
          <p class="mb-4">
              Our deterministic math model for the main quorum sensing circuit focuses upon controlling the bacterial population at a level quite below the original carrying capacity of the control bacterial population, thereby increasing the media potential in the process due to slower consumption of substrates as well as slower accumulation of secondary metabolites in the media. We also aim to achieve an oscillation at the population level to reflect the efficient working of the negative feedback loop in the main circuit, as demonstrated in several studies performing quorum sensing in bacterial populations.
          </p>
          <p class="mb-4">
              Our target of controlling the population at the desired threshold level by inducing cell arrest rather than cell lysis is achieved by modifying the logistic growth equation to incorporate a growth reduction factor to the population growth term, proportional to the concentration of the antisense mRNA of DnaA transcribed by our circuit. An additional death term has also been introduced to bring about the death phase in the bacterial population, upon referring to the growth equation formulated by Xiang Li et al. The logistic growth equation for our model is given below:
              <code>dNdt = r0(1+m*[CCA]r3)N â€“ r0K N2 â€“ aNt4(t4+ b4)(1+c*Sn)</code>
