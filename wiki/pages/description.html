            <p class="text-lg mb-6">As you are reading this, you stand on your feet, and around you millions of others wade through their daily lives in this mile-a-minute world. Let us pause for a second and wonder how many of those million footfalls are ‘comfortable’ in the true sense.
                A moisture-retaining, dark, warm setting, ideal for the micro-world is more than accounted for by your shoes. If worn for long periods regularly, these shoes cause bacteria and fungi to thrive giving to rise to deadly bacterial and fungal foot infections which are anything but skin-deep. 
                It is said that 20% of the entire population of India which accounts for about 200 million of us are likely to have Athlete’s foot, a serious foot fungal infection, at some point in life. And Athlete’s Foot is just the tip of the iceberg! There are many more such diseases to wreak havoc, giving rise to pain, inflammation and days gone by on medications.
                Diabetic patients show higher tendency of suffering from stubborn, serious microbial infections of the lower limbs. A whopping 33 million are affected by DFU globally. Diabetic foot ulcers might lead to serious complications which might even lead to amputation of a limb, due to necrosis from infection.

Of course, we do have existing solutions such as foot creams, artificial fragrances, and other topical remedies for a foot sore. However, let us pause and think, what does that bottle of medicine actually do to you?</p>
                    <p>The most common drugs used to treat foot microbial infections such as terbinafine, clotrimazole, ketoconazole, among others, lead to various side-effects, gynaecomastia, hormonal imbalances such as adrenal insufficiency, and liver diseases among others.</p>

                    <p>Team E.solei takes a step ahead of your everyday foot cream by designing such a foot insole, to be placed inside the shoe, which would house an ecosystem of bacteria. The bacteria are genetically modified to produce certain such volatile organic molecules which produce an overall protective, caring effect on the foot. The GM bacteria (our chassis) survive on a nutrient medium placed in the sole, producing organic volatiles which would escape through the porous medium into the foot environment. 
                        We exploit the concept of Live Application wherein the GM bacteria survive on a medium, in proximity to the foot environment, while producing a fragrant molecule, which also has certain anti-microbial and anti-inflammatory properties. The molecule creates a healthy environment for the foot, while neutralising the bad odour.
                    </p><br>
                    <p> 
                        Whenever Live Application comes into play, we have a fishbone in dealing with early depletion of media by the bacteria. Due to this, the bacteria cannot sustain itself on that media for a long time and linalool production stops after some time. This may lead to reduced turn-over of the product and repeated changes of insole with new media.
                        To tackle this, our product has an inbuilt regulating mechanism in the GM bacteria, which controls the population, having oscillations around a certain stable population, so that the production of linalool is maintained and usage of media is optimised. By doing this we prolong media depletion and we make the turn-over more efficient, reducing consumer effort. 
                        The product also promises to have greater regions of applicability because the volatiles produced are small in size and readily escape to spread to the entire foot environment. 
                        Finally through Live Application we ban use of chemicals in our product. We use a layer of self-sufficient live organism, whose maintenance doesn’t require introduction of harmful chemicals, nor increases carbon footprint!

                    <p>E.solei comes in the form of a foot insole, split into several layers. Within the insole, a layer of biocompatible, nutrient-extractable polymer houses the GM bacteria. This layer is guarded by a non-porous layer at the bottom, which prevents the bacteria from leaking out. Another porous layer sandwiches the biopolymer layer from top, designed in such a way that the target volatile escapes but not the bacteria.</p>

                    <p>We chose Linalool as our target compound, which would be produced by the GM Bacteria. A mono-terpenoid, as well as a tertiary alcohol, Linalool is produced as a plant metabolite. It has a pleasant fragrance and is a volatile oil compound. Besides being involved industrially in the manufacturing of soaps, fragrances, food additives as flavours, insecticides, it also a part of complex pollination mechanism of various plant species to ensure reproduction and survival.</p>
                    <p>Linalool has antifungal and antibacterial, anti-inflammatory (reduces skin irritation) and wound-healing properties, as well as a characteristic pleasant fragrance of a lavender, making it an obvious choice in caring for the foot.
