              Our feet, often the most neglected part of the body, are susceptible to fungal and bacterial infections due to the cosy, humid conditions in shoes. These infections cause itchy, flaky skin and foul odours, often ignored until they lead to serious secondary infections. Despite available antifungal and antibacterial treatments, they require frequent application and can be easily washed away. This is impractical for those with long working hours, such as office-goers, athletes, construction workers, and students, who cannot tend to their feet regularly. Existing fragrant products also pose environmental hazards. Inspired by these challenges, our project, E. solei, aims to provide a lasting, eco-friendly solution that keeps feet fresh, odour-free, and protected from infections without the need for constant reapplication.

              <h2>Why we choose this?</h2>
              <p>Feet, the least cared-for part of our body, suffer significantly from fungal and bacterial skin diseases, causing substantial disability. In India, the non-fatal burden of these diseases surpasses that of cardiovascular diseases, with years lived with disability rising from 4.07 million in 1990 to 6.26 million in 2017. Students, professionals, athletes, firefighters, policemen, and soldiers face persistent foot care challenges due to prolonged shoe wear, leading to infections and foot odour. Soldiers in hot, humid conditions show high rates of bacterial (21.2%) and fungal (23.3%) infections. Despite existing solutions, a more effective, convenient, and long-lasting foot care solution is needed to prevent and treat these infections, especially for those unable to tend to their feet regularly. The rise in fungal infections, coupled with issues like prosthetic malfunctions and diabetes, highlights the urgent need for innovative solutions like E. solei.</p>

              <h2>PROOF OF CONCEPT</h2>
              <p>A proof of concept (POC) in design is a small exercise to test the design idea or assumption. It's about quickly creating a working prototype to demonstrate the feasibility of a design solution. POCs help in validating ideas, identifying potential issues early, and gaining stakeholder buy-in before investing significant resources into full-scale development.</p>
