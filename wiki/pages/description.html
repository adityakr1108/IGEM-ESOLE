    <h2> Inspiration</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>Our feet, often the most neglected part of the body, are susceptible to fungal and bacterial infections due to the cosy, humid conditions in shoes. These infections cause itchy, flaky skin and foul odours, often ignored until they lead to serious secondary infections. Despite available antifungal and antibacterial treatments, they require frequent application and can be easily washed away. This is impractical for those with long working hours, such as office-goers, athletes, construction workers, and students, who cannot tend to their feet regularly. Existing fragrant products also pose environmental hazards. Inspired by these challenges, our project, E. solei, aims to provide a lasting, eco-friendly solution that keeps feet fresh, odour-free, and protected from infections without the need for constant reapplication.</p>

    <h2> Why we choose this ?</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>Feet, the least cared-for part of our body, suffer significantly from fungal and bacterial skin diseases, causing substantial disability. In India, the non-fatal burden of these diseases surpasses that of cardiovascular diseases, with years lived with disability rising from 4.07 million in 1990 to 6.26 million in 2017. Students, professionals, athletes, firefighters, policemen, and soldiers face persistent foot care challenges due to prolonged shoe wear, leading to infections and foot odour. Soldiers in hot, humid conditions show high rates of bacterial (21.2%) and fungal (23.3%) infections. Despite existing solutions, a more effective, convenient, and long-lasting foot care solution is needed to prevent and treat these infections, especially for those unable to tend to their feet regularly. The rise in fungal infections, coupled with issues like prosthetic malfunctions and diabetes, highlights the urgent need for innovative solutions like E. solei.</p>

    <h2>How we cure this?</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>Our project, E. solei, introduces an innovative foot care solution using genetically modified E. coli to release broad-spectrum antifungal, antibacterial, and fragrant molecules, effectively addressing several foot-related infections. These include athlete's foot (Tinea pedis) caused by Trichophyton species, yeast infections from Candida albicans, and toenail fungus (onychomycosis) caused by various fungi. It also combats bacterial infections, such as those from Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus species, which can lead to cellulitis. Additionally, it helps reduce foot odour (bromodosis) resulting from bacterial overgrowth.

    By leveraging the mevalonate pathway, our solution is to produce linalool, a terpenoid known for its potent antifungal and antibacterial properties. The key to our project's sustainability lies in inducing reversible cell cycle arrest, allowing the bacteria to maintain prolonged activity and effectiveness through intermittent natural cell cycles. This oscillatory growth pattern is carefully regulated via quorum sensing mechanisms involving the LuxI gene, which produces AHL molecules. When AHL concentration reaches a critical threshold, it binds to LuxR, activating the P_lux promoter to initiate transcription of the cell cycle arrest gene and AiiA, an AHL inactivator. The AiiA, targeted for degradation by ClpXP protease, releases cells from arrest as AHL levels decrease, ensuring a balanced bacterial population and optimal efficacy.

    To further enhance safety and usability, we propose implementing a media-dependent kill switch that activates if the GMO is detached from its designated medium, preventing accidental release. Additionally, a dye indicator within the bacterial medium signals saturation, prompting users to replace it with a fresh pouch, ensuring continuous protection. This design ensures that E. solei not only provides long-lasting antifungal action but also integrates seamlessly into daily life, reducing the need for frequent reapplication and offering an eco-friendly alternative to chemical-laden deodorants. This comprehensive approach addresses both the prevention and treatment of fungal infections, making it a superior and sustainable solution in foot care.</p>

    <h2>Our solution vs Existing Solution</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>Existing antifungal solutions treat infections but do not prevent them, require frequent reapplication, and can be washed away easily making them impractical for long-term use. In contrast, E. solei offers a preventive and adjuvant solution by creating an environment hostile to fungi, ensuring long-lasting protection through a replenishable medium. This innovative approach prevents the development of fungal resistance by maintaining gradual, sustained broad-spectrum activity. E. solei’s volatile molecules reach deep into skin crevices and under nails, areas that creams often miss. Additionally, it releases eco-friendly, organic fragrances, unlike conventional deodorants that emit harmful pollutants. E. solei is also consumer-friendly, integrated seamlessly into shoes for continuous protection without the need for frequent application. This synthetic biology-based solution not only addresses foot fungal infections effectively but can also be adapted to treat other fungal invasions, promising broader applicability and a significant improvement in quality of life for a wide range of users.</p>
