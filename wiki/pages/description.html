            <p>
                As you are reading this, you stand on your feet, and around you millions of others wade through their daily lives in this mile-a-minute world. Let us pause for a second and wonder how many of those million footfalls are ‘comfortable’ in the true sense.
                A moisture-retaining, dark, warm setting, ideal for the micro-world is more than accounted for by your shoes. If worn for long periods regularly, these shoes cause bacteria and fungi to thrive, giving rise to deadly bacterial and fungal foot infections which are anything but skin-deep.
            </p>
            <p class="mt-4">
                It is said that 20% of the entire population of India, which accounts for about 200 million of us, are likely to have Athlete’s foot, a serious foot fungal infection, at some point in life. And Athlete’s Foot is just the tip of the iceberg! There are many more such diseases wreaking havoc, causing pain, inflammation, and days gone by on medications.

            <p class="mt-4 text-gray-700">Imagine bad odour and a stubborn itch on the foot, being your top priority. Of course, we do have existing solutions such as foot creams, artificial fragrances, and other topical remedies for a foot sore. However, let us pause and think, what does that bottle of medicine actually do to you?</p>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-blue-600">What is in your bottle of perfume?</h2>
            <p class="mt-4 text-gray-700">Bringing it down to the common-man’s problems, foot creams and other topical remedies greatly increase consumer effort, besides having lower regions of applicability. A foot cream might not reach the crevices of your foot-skin, is quite washable and thus it reduces efficiency by a huge factor, not to mention the cost of it all and repeated expenditure on such drugs!</p>

            <p class="mt-4 text-gray-700">An ingenious foot-care solution is the need of the hour!</p>
            <h2 class="mt-6 text-2xl font-bold text-blue-600">WHAT ARE WE BRINGING TO THE TABLE?</h2>
            <p class="mt-4 text-gray-700">Team E.solei takes a step ahead of your everyday foot cream by designing a foot insole, to be placed inside the shoe, which would house an ecosystem of bacteria.</p>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-blue-600">WHAT WILL OUR PRODUCT LOOK LIKE?</h2>
            <p class="mt-4 text-gray-700">E.solei comes in the form of a foot insole, split into several layers. Within the insole, a layer of biocompatible, nutrient-extractable polymer houses the GM bacteria. This layer is guarded by a non-porous layer at the bottom.</p>

            <h3 class="mt-4 text-xl font-semibold text-blue-500">Linalool: Looking Beyond Medications</h3>
            <p class="mt-4 text-gray-700">We chose Linalool as our target compound, which would be produced by the GM Bacteria. Linalool is a plant metabolite that has a pleasant fragrance and is a volatile oil compound. It is also involved in various industries, including soap, fragrance, and food additive manufacturing.</p>

            <p class="mt-4 text-gray-700">Lactobacillus rhamnosus is a well-established pro-biotic commonly found in the gut. It is known for producing antimicrobial compounds like 3-phenyllactic acid, which exhibits strong antifungal properties. This would complement the production of linalool, enhancing the foot-bed's efficacy in managing skin health.</p>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-blue-600">MODULE 1: PRODUCTION OF THE TARGET COMPOUND LINALOOL</h2>
            <p class="mt-4 text-gray-700">Linalool is produced as a metabolite in plants through the Mevalonate Pathway (MEV Pathway). We aim to incorporate this pathway in our chassis and turn on the production of Linalool.</p>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-blue-600">MODULE 2: SUSTENANCE OF LINALOOL PRODUCTION</h2>
            <p class="mt-4 text-gray-700">We regulate the population level of the GM bacteria, maintaining oscillations around a stable population level. By optimizing Linalool production and media usage, we increase the depletion time of the media and sustain product usage.</p>

            <h3 class="mt-4 text-xl font-semibold text-blue-500">Creating a GMO with a mind of its own!</h3>
            <p class="mt-4 text-gray-700">We plan to incorporate the two modules mentioned above in our chassis by co-transforming the plasmids housing the genes for both. This will allow for automated regulation of population levels and efficient usage of nutrient media.</p>

            <p class="mt-4 text-gray-700">The GMO is housed in a biopolymer that acts as a nutrient-extractable source. The bacteria are made dormant prior to embedding through Lyophilisation techniques, and a kill-switch ensures no leakage of bacteria into the environment.</p>
