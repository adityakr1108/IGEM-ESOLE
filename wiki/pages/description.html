                <p class="mb-3">Imagine bad odour and a stubborn itch on the foot, being your top priority. Of course, we do have existing solutions such as foot creams, artificial fragrances, and other topical remedies for a foot sore. However, let us pause and think, what does that bottle of medicine actually do to you?</p>
                <p>The most common drugs used to treat foot microbial infections such as terbinafine, clotrimazole, ketoconazole, among others, lead to various side-effects, gynaecomastia, hormonal imbalances such as adrenal insufficiency, and liver diseases among others.</p>

                <p>Bringing it down to the common-man's problems, foot creams and other topical remedies greatly increase consumer effort, besides having lower regions of applicability. A foot cream might not reach the crevices of your foot-skin, is quite washable and thus it reduces efficiency by a huge factor, not to mention the cost of it all and repeated expenditure on such drugs!</p>

                <p>Team E.solei takes a step ahead of your everyday foot cream by designing such a foot insole, to be placed inside the shoe, which would house an ecosystem of bacteria. The bacteria are genetically modified to produce certain such volatile organic molecules which produce an overall protective, caring effect on the foot. The GM bacteria (our chassis) survive on a nutrient medium placed in the sole, producing organic volatiles which would escape through the porous medium into the foot environment.</p>
                <p>We exploit the concept of Live Application wherein the GM bacteria survive on a medium, in proximity to the foot environment, while producing a fragrant molecule, which also has significant anti-microbial and anti-inflammatory properties. This molecule creates a healthy environment for the foot, while neutralising bad odour.</p>

                <p>E.solei comes in the form of a foot insole, split into several layers. Within the insole, a layer of biocompatible, nutrient-extractable polymer houses the GM bacteria. This layer is guarded by a non-porous layer at the bottom, which prevents the bacteria from leaking out. Another porous layer sandwiches the biopolymer layer from top, designed in such a way that the target volatile escapes but not the bacteria.</p>

                <p>We chose Linalool as our target compound, which would be produced by the GM Bacteria. A mono-terpenoid, as well as a tertiary alcohol, Linalool is produced as a plant metabolite. It has a pleasant fragrance and is a volatile oil compound. Besides being involved industrially in the manufacturing of soaps, fragrances, food additives as flavours, insecticides, it also a part of complex pollination mechanism of various plant species to ensure reproduction and survival.</p>

                <p class="mb-4">Linalool is produced as a metabolite in plants through the Mevalonate Pathway (MEV Pathway). We aim to incorporate this pathway in our chassis and turn on the production of Linalool.</p>
                <p class="mb-4">The MEV pathway intrinsically creates mono-terpenes with two isoprene units. We choose to redirect the pathway into producing our desired compound. For this we place genes of interest and transform them into our GM bacteria.</p>

                <p class="mb-4">In many of the treatments exploiting the concept of Live Application we face problems of small activation window of the product due to which the efficiency of the product goes down and we required repeated, frequent application.</p>
                <p class="mb-4">Here we regulate the population level of the GM bacteria and hence by maintaining oscillations about a particular population level we optimize Linalool production and media usage. Hence we increase the depletion time for the media, sustaining linalool production and product usage for a longer period of time.</p>

                <p class="mb-4">We plan to incorporate the above two modules mentioned in our chassis by co-transforming the plasmids housing the genes for the two modules. These co-transformed bacteria would behave as an automated machine where each would sense and halt its division in such a way so that the overall population is maintained. Our GMO is thus equipped to utilize the nutrient-media efficiently and produce Linalool for a longer time than other such products.</p>

            <div class="bg-indigo-50 p-6 rounded-lg shadow-md">
                <p class="mb-4">The GMO is housed in biopolymer which simultaneously acts as a nutrient-extractable source for the GMO which lives on incorporated within that layer. We would alter pore size and porosity in such a way so as to ensure no leakage of bacteria outside the foot insole.</p>
                <p class="mb-4">The bacteria being made dormant prior to embedding by standard Lyophilisation techniques are induced, signaling the start of usage of product and Linalool's emergence into the picture.</p>
                <p class="mb-4">We design a kill-switch which would induce death in the bacteria whenever it detaches from its medium, ensuring no escape of GMO into the environment and thereby safety.</p>
                <p class="mb-4">Polymers are cheap, and easily available and hence the perfect choice for providing a base camp for our GMO.</p>
                <p class="mb-4">E.solei finally comes in as a foot insole, suitable for any type of shoe but more so as a small step we take for a whopping 9 million of us, out of which someone would be sitting right this second at the clinic, in pain with a foot fungal infection, wondering what an ingenious foot care solution would look like!</p>
