<p>Upon talking with people in industry we have learned about the rough cost estimation which will be appropriate for our product.</p>

<img src="https://static.igem.wiki/teams/5425/entrepreneurship/23.webp" style="width:80%;"><br><br>

<h1>Profit Margin</h1>

<p>Assuming a profit margin of 20%, the profit will be:<br><br>

Profit = Total Cost x20/100<br><br>

Profit = 180x 0.2 = &#8377;36<br><br>

Thus, the cost before GST is:<br><br>

Cost before GST = 180 + 36 = &#8377;216<br><br>

GST is applied to the cost before GST, which is &#8377;216<br><br>

The GST rate is 12%:<br><br>

GST = 216x12/100 = &#8377;25.92<br><br>

The final selling price, including GST, is:<br><br>

Final price= 216 + 25.92 = &#8377;241.92 </p>

<h1>PRODUCT EXPANSION</h1>

<img src="https://static.igem.wiki/teams/5425/entrepreneurship/images-2.webp" style="width:80%;">
<p>Upon successful launching of a product, it is important to keep up the sales but despite all, upon reaching the maturity phase the sales decline. Thus, it is always important to explore different dimensions with the product and extend them. The technology which we are using currently can also be used for the production of other products too such as :-</p>

<img src="https://static.igem.wiki/teams/5425/entrepreneurship/27.webp" style="width:80%;">

<p>To determine the cost effectiveness of our bacterial method of linalool production, we compared our method of production with the traditional method in which linalool is produced/extracted in industries. We accordingly performed the following cost comparison analysis of the 2 different methods of linalool production as given below :-</p>

<img src="https://static.igem.wiki/teams/5425/entrepreneurship/illustration-dog-vs-cat-comparison-table-pinterest-pin.webp">

<p>We thus conclude that our Bacterial method of production of linalool is more cost effective than the traditional industrial method of production.<br><br>
 
Profit / kg linalool produced if it is produced through GMO instead of extraction from plants = $4.8.<br><br>
Hence, if we assume a batch production of linalool where 1000 kg of the compound is being produced through our GMO, <b><br>then our total profit will be
= $4.8 x 1000 = $4800.</b><br><br>
 
Converting the profit value to INR, we would have a profit of <b>Rs. 3,98,400</b> in a batch production of linalool through our GMO.<br><br>
 
This large profit harnessed through the production of linalool through GMO indeed reasons that our method of production of linalool is way more cost effective than the production of linalool through its extraction from plants ; and because of which we might also produce lab grade linalool in future.</p><br>


<h1>Future</h1>
<p>Team E.solei wants to make it big! We have planned to develop our product and finally launch it, maintaining all guidelines in the next 3-4 years. We have also planned to expand our business after  3 years of successful launch!</p>

<h1>Exit Strategy for E. solei</h1> 

<p>Our exit strategy for E. solei focuses on creating the best possible outcome for everyone involved, from our team to our partners and customers. We&#39;ve explored several potential paths that allow us to continue growing while ensuring the long-term success of our business. Here are a few scenarios we&#39;re considering:-</p>

<h2>1. Acquisition by a Larger Footwear or Health-Tech Company dropdown</h2>

<p>One option for us is being acquired by a larger company in the footwear, sportswear, or health-tech industries. With the innovative technology behind our biotech-driven insoles, we could catch the attention of major brands looking to expand their product lines. This kind of acquisition would allow E. solei to scale quickly, using the resources and infrastructure of an established company.</p>

<h2>2. Merger with a Complementary Business dropdown</h2>

<p>We could also merge with another company that complements what we do, whether in the footwear, biotechnology, or health-tech space. By combining forces, we&#39;d be able to share resources, technology, and customer bases, which would help both companies grow faster and reach more people.</p>

<h2>3. Licensing or Joint Ventures dropdown</h2>

<p>Another potential path is to license our insole technology to larger manufacturers or partner with companies through joint ventures. This way, we can keep ownership of our technology but let other businesses use it and distribute it under their brand. This strategy allows us to benefit from their reach without having to handle the production and distribution ourselves.</p>

<h2>4. IPO (Initial Public Offering) dropdown</h2>

<p>If E. solei continues to gain momentum and grow, we might explore the option of going public. An Initial Public Offering (IPO) would allow us to raise additional capital to expand even further, invest in research and development, and enter new markets. It would also give our early supporters and team members a chance to benefit from our growth.</p>

<p>This approach ensures we consider all possibilities for E. solei&#39;s future, keeping in mind the best interests of our stakeholders while staying true to our mission of bringing innovative, health-focused insole solutions to the market.</p><br>

<h2><i>E.solei always wanted to make it big, but before that we wanted to make a difference! We wanted to reach out to the next door but also to the next generation!</i><h2><br><br>
